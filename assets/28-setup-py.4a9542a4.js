The main purpose of the setup script is to describe your module distribution to the Distutils, so that the various commands that operate on your modules do the right thing.</p><p>The <code>setup.py</code> file is at the heart of a Python project. It describes all the metadata about your project. There are quite a few fields you can add to a project to give it a rich set of metadata describing the project. However, there are only three required fields: name, version, and packages. The name field must be unique if you wish to publish your package on the Python Package Index (PyPI). The version field keeps track of different releases of the project. The package\u2019s field describes where you\u2019ve put the Python source code within your project.</p><p>This allows you to easily install Python packages. Often it\u2019s enough to write:</p><pre class="language-bash"><code class="language-bash">python setup.py <span class="token function">install</span>
